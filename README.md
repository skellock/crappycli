A crappy [`nim`](https://nim-lang.org) package for parsing command line arguments.


### Warning

I'm new at `nim` and am extracting this from one of my projects to get used to writing packages.

You probably want to use one of the many other CLI argument parsing packages instead.  ðŸ˜ƒ


# Installing

`nimble install https://github.com/skellock/crappycli`

Or, hey, just copy the `crappycli.nim` file and paste it into your project. ðŸ’ƒ


# Usage

```nim
import crappycli

# new crappy cli!
let cli = newCrappyCli()

# check for a switch that's just a flag
cli.has("force")

# read a switch that has a value
cli["output"]

# read a switch as an int with a fallback
cli.intValue("l", 100)

# read a switch as a string with a fallback
cli.stringValue("p", "party")


# read positional arguments
cli.first
cli.second
cli.third
cli.last
cli.nth(1) # reads the 1st positional argument (1-based ðŸ¤“)

# count some stuff
cli.switchCount
cli.positionalCount
cli.empty
```

### Ambiguous Switches

Sometimes your switches will be flags; meaning, they don't have a value associated with them.

By default, switches consume the next word after them... so, if you want to keep those as positional arguments, then you've gotta tell `CrappyCli` about your flags up front.

Look, I told ya it was crappy! ðŸŽ°

```nim
# alternate way to create it by telling it switches
# which have no values
let cli = commandLineParams.newCrappyCli(
  flags = @["verbose"]
)

# ^ used for corner cases where you have positionals
# right after switches, for example:
#
#   mycli -v filename.json
#
# ^ in this case, we want the `-v` to be a flag and
# the `filename.json` to be a positional.
```

### DIY commandLineParams

By default, `CrappyCli` tries to read from `commandLineParams` from `os`. You can override this:

```nim
let cli = commandLineParams.newCrappyCli(
  params = @["omg", "custom", "-v"]
)
```
